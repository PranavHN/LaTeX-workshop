## Setting up LaTeX

Recommend you do this before the workshop, as it can take a while to install LaTeX and the necessary packages.

- Running LaTeX on your computer:

  1. Install a LaTeX distribution:
     - Windows: [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/)
     - Mac: [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)
     - Linux: [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (but check with your distro and/or package manager first)
  2. Install a LaTeX editor:
     - TeXworks is included with MikTeX and MacTeX (Neil's recommendation)
     - Texmaker/TeXstudio is a popular open-source LaTeX editor (Pranav's recommendation)
  3. Ensure any necessary packages are installed:
     - If you are using a LaTeX editor, it should handle this for you
     - If you are using a command-line interface, you may need to install packages manually using the package manager for your LaTeX distribution (e.g. `tlmgr` for TeX Live)

- Running LaTeX online:
  - [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is the most popular online LaTeX editor (arguably most popular LaTeX editor in general). You will need to create an account to use it, but it is free to use.
